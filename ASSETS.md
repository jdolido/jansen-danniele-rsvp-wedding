Drop the provided invitation image into the `public/` folder with this filename:

- `public/invitation-bg.jpg`

Notes:
- Vite serves files from `public/` at the site root, so the CSS rule in `src/invitation.css` references `/invitation-bg.jpg`.
- If you want a different filename or folder, update `src/invitation.css` accordingly.
